### 2. Movie Recommendation System Optimization

**Scenario:** StreamFlix OTT Platform  
A popular OTT platform, StreamFlix, offers personalized recommendations by sorting movies based on user preferences, such as IMDB rating, release year, or watch time popularity. However, during peak hours, sorting large datasets slows down the system.

**Role:** Backend Engineer

**Requirements:**

- Implement Quicksort to efficiently sort movies based on various user-selected parameters
- Handle large datasets containing millions of movies while maintaining fast response times
- Support multiple sorting criteria:
  - IMDB rating
  - Release year
  - Watch time popularity

**Objectives:**

- Optimize system performance during peak hours
- Ensure scalability for large movie datasets
- Maintain fast response times for user requests

### 3. Emergency Relief Supply Distribution

**Scenario:** Flood Relief Operation  
A devastating flood has hit multiple villages in a remote area, and the government, along with NGOs, is organizing an emergency relief operation. A rescue team has a limited-capacity boat that can carry a maximum weight of W kilograms.

**Role:** Logistics Manager

**Problem Details:**
The boat must transport critical supplies (food, medicine, drinking water) from a relief center to affected villages. Each relief item has:

- **Weight (wi):** in kilograms
- **Utility value (vi):** indicating importance (medicine > food)
- **Divisibility:** Some items can be divided (food, water), others cannot (medical kits)

**Requirements:**

1. Implement the **Fractional Knapsack algorithm** to maximize total utility value
2. Prioritize high-value items while considering weight constraints
3. Allow partial selection of divisible items (e.g., fraction of food packets)
4. Ensure optimal supply distribution given weight limit W

**Expected Outcome:**
Maximize the utility value of supplies transported while respecting the boat's weight capacity.

### 4. Smart Traffic Management for Emergency Vehicles

**Scenario:** Intelligent Traffic System for Ambulances  
A smart city is implementing an intelligent traffic management system to assist ambulances in reaching hospitals as quickly as possible.

**Role:** Transportation Engineer

**System Model:**

- **Nodes:** Intersections (junctions)
- **Edges:** Roads with weights representing travel time (considering traffic congestion)
- **Dynamic:** Weights change in real-time based on traffic conditions

**Requirements:**

1. Implement **Dijkstra's algorithm** to find shortest path from ambulance location (S) to all possible hospitals
2. Account for dynamic weight updates as traffic conditions change
3. Optimize for large cities with thousands of intersections and roads
4. Provide visual representation of optimal path for navigation

**Expected Outcome:**
The system should suggest the quickest route for ambulances, updating dynamically based on real-time traffic conditions, ensuring minimal emergency response time.

### 5. Multi-Stage Delivery Route Optimization

**Scenario:** SwiftCargo Logistics Company  
SwiftCargo specializes in delivering packages across multiple cities. The company divides the transportation network into multiple stages (warehouses, transit hubs, and final delivery points).

**Role:** Logistics Optimization Engineer

**Network Model:**

- **Structure:** Directed, weighted multistage graph
- **Stages:** N predefined stages (warehouses → transit hubs → delivery points)
- **Constraint:** Every package must pass through at least one node in each stage

**Requirements:**

1. Model transportation network as a directed, weighted multistage graph
2. Implement efficient algorithm (Dynamic Programming or Dijkstra's Algorithm) for optimal delivery routes
3. Scale for large datasets (thousands of cities and routes)
4. Analyze and optimize route selection based on real-time constraints:
   - Traffic conditions
   - Weather delays
   - Fuel efficiency

**Additional Constraints:**

- Multiple paths with different costs/times between stages
- Handle real-time changes (road closures, rerouting)
- Support batch processing for multiple delivery requests

**Expected Outcome:**
Cost-efficient and time-optimized delivery routes that adapt to real-time conditions and scale for large logistics networks.

### 6. Disaster Relief Resource Allocation

**Scenario:** Earthquake Relief Operation  
A massive earthquake has struck a remote region, and a relief organization is transporting essential supplies to the affected area. The organization has a limited-capacity relief truck that can carry a maximum weight of W kg.

**Role:** Logistics Coordinator

**Problem Details:**
They have N different types of essential items, each with:

- **Weight (wi):** in kilograms
- **Utility value (vi):** importance in saving lives and meeting urgent needs
- **Indivisibility:** Each item must be either completely included or excluded

**Requirements:**

1. Model this problem using the **0/1 Knapsack approach**, where each item can either be included in the truck (1) or not (0)
2. Implement an algorithm using **Dynamic Programming** to find the optimal set of items that maximizes utility while staying within the weight constraint
3. Analyze the performance of different approaches (e.g., Brute Force, Dynamic Programming, and Greedy Algorithms) for solving this problem efficiently
4. Optimize for real-world constraints, such as perishable items (medicines, food) having priority over less critical supplies

**Extension:**
Extend the model to consider multiple trucks or real-time decision-making for dynamic supply chain management.

**Expected Outcome:**
Maximize the total utility value of supplies transported while ensuring the total weight does not exceed the truck's limit, with priority given to critical items.

### 7. University Timetable Scheduling

**Scenario:** University Exam Scheduling System  
A university is facing challenges in scheduling exam timetables due to overlapping student enrollments in multiple courses. To prevent clashes, the university needs to assign exam slots efficiently, ensuring that no two exams taken by the same student are scheduled at the same time.

**Role:** Scheduling System Developer

**Problem Model:**
The problem is modeled as a **Graph Coloring Problem**, where:

- **Vertices:** Each course is represented as a vertex
- **Edges:** An edge exists between two vertices if a student is enrolled in both courses
- **Colors:** Each vertex (course) must be assigned a color (time slot) such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color

**Requirements:**

1. Model the problem as a graph and implement a **graph coloring algorithm** (e.g., Greedy Coloring or DSATUR)
2. Minimize the number of colors (exam slots) needed while ensuring conflict-free scheduling
3. Handle large datasets with thousands of courses and students, optimizing performance
4. Compare the efficiency of **Greedy Coloring**, **DSATUR**, and **Welsh-Powell algorithms** for better scheduling

**Extension:**
Extend the solution to include room allocation constraints where exams in the same slot should fit within available classrooms.

**Expected Outcome:**
An optimized exam schedule that minimizes the number of time slots required while ensuring no student has conflicting exams.
